# Fediverse

![](/app/src/blue/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_round.png)

Fediverse is a beautiful Android client for accessing the fediverse of GNU social-compatible social networks. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.
